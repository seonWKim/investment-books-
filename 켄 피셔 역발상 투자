# Contrarian Investment 

Contrarian investment should make use of the public 
- We are not moving in the opposite direction from the public, we are moving in DIFFERENT direction 

People can see what is happening 
- We should see what can happen more  

Market's will seldom move in inefficient directions. But they will conclude with an efficient state. 
- Market always has a cycle 
- We don't have to respond to every minor movements 

Why analyst fails on prediction 
- They concentrate on the annual profit, but the market cycle doesn't fit into a year 
- Even the companies focus on the annual profit. Where's the long term vision? 
- Let's not focus on the ANNUAL THING!! 

How we can make use of the analyst reports? 
- There is a high possibility that the market has already applied the market analysis to its price 
- Write down all the market predictions. Find where the predictions gather and exclude those cause the market will not move in those directions(with high possibility) 
- Market directions can be in one of: 
  - Significant increase 
  - Slight increase 
  - Slight decrease 
  - Significant decrease 
- Find the facts which the analysts are missing e.g. What are the impacts of the war, ...  

REMEMBER that the market tries to make fun of as much people as possible.
